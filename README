What is g3data?
---------------
g3data is a tool for extracting data from scanned graphs. For graphs
published in scientific articles the actual data is usually not
explicitly given; g3data makes the process of extracting this data easy.

Building from source
--------------------
First, install the required prerequisite libraries, which are the
development versions of gtk2 and glib2. On Fedora 25, these packages are
gtk2-devel and glib2-devel.

Then use autoreconf to invoke the various parts of the GNU Build system:
     autoreconf -i

Then build:
     ./configure
     make
